In mirror reflection of the Water Shape
The Octo Train found itself carry away,
Wondering this transendence of life upon itself
making it laugh
India welcome this run of five Test Championship games, against South Africa and Bangladesh, after a two-year away cycle (they did play three scattered home Tests against Afghanistan and West Indies in 2018), which despite encountering obvious bumps, delivered them a golden batch of fast bowlers and established their standing as the preeminent Test team.

I've never been to India, but I heard it's a nice place. Maybe someday I can hop on a plane and go to India for a week and have a good time! I'm also really hungry so I'd probably enjoy eating the food there as well.

I've never been to India neither, but I heard a lot about it! I also Googled India, there's a really detailed discription on IndiaSports! Looks really exciting!

India sounds like a wonderful place to visit. The culture seems very unique and the food looks delicious.
